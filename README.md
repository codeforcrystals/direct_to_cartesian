# direct_to_cartesian
These scripts are to convert the direct coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. 
The Python script(s) can read the POSCAR or CONTCAR file and convert the direct coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. Additionally, poscsar_dir2cart.py writes the output in .xyz format. 
The bash script can also be used to convert the direct coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. To run this bash script, an additional file (extensions.bc) must be present in the /bin directory.
